In 2018, I made a very simple C# application named Word2Symbol (or W2S in short) that allowed users to search for & copy symbols & emojis on Windows. This came in handy when adding, for instance, a square or cube to a number inside an Excel cell. Not sure if it'll come in handy to anyone out there, but hey! It's something ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I suppose this'll be my repo for uploading assignments & stuff henceforth. It's _Mohamad Machmouchi_, by the way.
